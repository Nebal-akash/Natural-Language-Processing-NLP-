NLP Learning Journey

This repository showcases my NLP learning progress during the week Monday, Sept 8, 2025 â€“ Friday, Sept 12, 2025.

Daily Progress

Monday (Sept 8, 2025): Learned core text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

Tuesday (Sept 9, 2025): Explored Term Frequency (TF), Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), and TF-IDF with hands-on examples.

Wednesday (Sept 10, 2025): Built sentiment analysis and sickness prediction models using embeddings.

Thursday (Sept 11, 2025): Implemented text-to-image generation with NLP prompts and experimented with multilingual text-to-speech.

Friday (Sept 12, 2025): Wrapped up the week by summarizing concepts, refining projects, and updating documentation.

Highlights

Covered both theoretical and practical aspects of NLP.

Built small projects to strengthen understanding.

Experimented with modern NLP applications like text-to-image and TTS.

Next Steps

Dive deeper into Named Entity Recognition (NER) and machine translation.

Work on larger datasets for real-world NLP use cases.

Continue documenting progress weekly.
